Basic Arduino sketch for color sensor TSC3200, will output readings to console.
To calibrate, start initial reading to a white surface.
Best results with RED and BLUE detection so far, poorer results with GREEN

Pins to Arduino:
VCC  to  12
GND  to GND
OE
LED  to  5V (disconnect if you don't need LEDs)
GND

S0   to   7
S1   to   6
S2   to   8
S3   to   9
OUT  to  10
